Introduction
------------

`make test' is used to test that the distribution was built correctly.

Make Variables
--------------

  The supported `make' variables consist of the following...

     LANG          REQUIRED.  The language to be tested.

  A detailed description of each variable follows...

     LANG=<lang>
       This variable is REQUIRED

          LANG=IDL allows to test the IRBEM-LIB (shared one) from 
	       IDL using the call_external command.

Examples
--------

  For example, to test the IRBEM-LIB distribution with IDL
  use the command...

     make LANG=IDL test

  Note that `test' is at the end of each command line after any `make'
  variables.
