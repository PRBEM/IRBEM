        <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA"><font size=+1>We provide a set of Python wrappers for
        the IRBEM Fortran library through the use of a shared library file (.so on Unix). 
        The wrapper is found in python/IRBEM.py. Python interfaces with the compiled shared 
        library file with ctypes.</font></font>

        <font size=+1>
	    <li> Compile the Fortran source as instructed by the README.install file. 
        This will create the shared object file, "onera_desp_lib_linux....so" in the  
        source firectory.</li>
      <li>Change directory into the python folder and add the Python wrapper paths 
          with "sudo python3 setup.py install"</li>
      <li>Check that the installation worked by running the provided test scripts 
        (...tests_and_visualizations.py).</li>
      <li>If the wrapper crashes with the error "Either none or multiple .so files
         found in the sources folder!", check that the shared object exists in the 
         source folder.</li>

        The Python wrapper IRBEM.py currently consists of two classes that load the shared object file. 
        This class interface is used to avoid redudant user input formatting code. IRBEM.py currently
        contains wrappers for the magnetic field library via the "MagFields" class and coordinate 
        transformation library via the "Coords" class. The two classes contain methods which interface
        with the various IRBEM functions e.g. make_lstar. The output from each IRBEM wrapped function 
        can be accesed with the usual return statement and "**FUNCTION_NAME**_output" class attributes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Current wrapped magnetic field functions are make_lstar, drift_shell, find_mirror_point,
        find_foot_point, trace_field_line, and find_magequator. For more documentation, call help(FUNCTION_NAME).
        <br />
        <br />
        Example code can be found in the ...test_and_visualizations.py files.
