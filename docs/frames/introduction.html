    <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">The International Radiation Belt Environment Modeling (IRBEM) library is freely distributed under the
    umbrella of <a href="http://cosparhq.cnes.fr/Scistr/Scistr.htm">COSPAR</a>'s <a href="https://prbem.github.io/">PRBEM (Panel on Radiation Belt Modeling</a>.<br>
    In 2003 ONERA-DESP (space environment department) decided to put together a set of source codes into a 
    library dedicated to radiation belt modeling. The toolkit was then called ONERA-DESP-LIB. Because the project has grown
    with time, and because its development is now an international collaborative effort, it was decided in 2008,
    after COSPAR 2008 Montreal assembly, to change the library name to IRBEM-LIB (which refers to COSPAR PRBEM panel) and to
    distribute it under the COSPAR PRBEM umbrella (a neutral body).</font>

        <br />
        <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">The following document describes how to
        use the IRBEM fortran library (formerly the ONERA-DESP library) to compute magnetic coordinates and drift shells
        using various external magnetic field models.&nbsp; Further routines are provided
        for&nbsp; various coordinate and time format transformations.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">The library can be called from FORTRAN
        or C code and from IDL&nbsp;or MATLAB code. For IDL and MATLAB wrappers are provided
        in the distribution package.</font>&nbsp; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">The package includes a Makefile 
        to built the library on various platform, install
        it&nbsp;and test it (See section installation for more details).&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA">Two libraries are created, one for access
        from IDL or MATLAB and one for access from fortran or some other language.</font>
