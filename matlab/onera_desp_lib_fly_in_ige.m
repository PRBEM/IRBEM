% returns geosynchronous electron flux from POLE/IGE models

% energy (in MeV):
% if energy is Nex1, returns differential flux at Ne energies (MeV-1 cm-2 s-1 sr-1)
% if energy is Nex2, returns differential flux from energy(:,1) to energy(:,2) (MeV-1 cm-2 s-1 sr-1)
% if energy(:,2) is all infinities, returns integral flux above energy(:,1) (cm-2 s-1 sr-1)
% output: all size Ne x 1
% Lower_flux: Lower flux for all energies averaged over entire mission
%   duration - This has to be considered as a lower envelop to bound
%   expected flux at GEO for any solar cycle 
% Mean_flux: Mean flux for all energies averaged over entire mission
%   duration - This spectrum is an averaged expected flux at GEO for any
%   solar cycle
% Upper_flux: Upper flux for all energies averaged over entire mission
%   duration - This has to be considered as an upper envelop for expected 
%   flux at GEO for any solar cycle
